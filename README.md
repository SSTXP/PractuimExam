the apps psuedocode:
0.start
1.declaration
2.input of values for the min and max tempretures
3.if the values are correct the app would continue with its function else the app will pop up an ertror message and delete previouse information 
4.min+max/2 = average tempreture(output)
end

On the second page there is an array set up from monday to sunday ,you then enter the minand max values aswell the conditions.
There are 3 buttons, a return button, a clear button and proceed button when you press proceed ot will take you to a break down of the week and the average tempretures per day 
my app did ork as follow due to an error occurring which never link the array with the textview
